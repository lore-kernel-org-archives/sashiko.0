If the device is Configuration-Ready or inaccessible after
platform_pci_set_power_state(PCI_D0), then I agree we shouldn't add
that delay in pci_power_up().

Strawman below.  "Inaccessible upon return" is bound to lead to
questions, but if the PCI core can't do anything I don't know what
else to say.

OK, so after platform_pci_set_power_state(PCI_D0), the device may be
in D3hot in some cases.  Then there's a D3hot -> D0 transition, and we
do pci_dev_d3_sleep(), but not pci_dev_wait().  Sec 2.3.1 says RRS is
permitted after a D3hot to D0uninitialized, and pci_dev_wait() is what
waits and retries for the RRS case.

It looks to me like we need pci_dev_wait() after that transition when
No_Soft_Reset == 0, i.e., something like the below.  Do you think this
is unnecessary?
