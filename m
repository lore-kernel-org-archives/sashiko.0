everyone *but* the hwmon list...

No, I want the replies. I was just wondering why it is not reply-all
which is standard. I was also wondering why I was only sometimes
seeing the reviews. I have since figured that out and submitted a PR
to add DT. I set it to reply-all, so I guess there will be some
comment about that.

I don't think there's any solution if a patch hits 2 conflicting
configurations. Surely the folks that don't want to see it can figure
out how to delete or ignore emails... I have thousands of ignored
emails. It's not hard. :)

If there's anything kernel developers agree on, it is not top posting.
I don't see how sashiko is special here. Isn't below the commit
message close enough to the top? I don't mind so much about the list
of issues being at the top, but I really don't see why the commit
message is not quoted (I would guess that's just an artifact of
creating the reply out of the git tree it was applied to?). The commit
hash is also completely useless to anyone without access to the git
tree sashiko uses.

One thing I would love to see is reviews of the commit message itself.
I would love to never have to say "don't use 'This commit/patch'" or
"the commit msg should answer why, not what" again.
