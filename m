No prob.

Yes, it does in general, but that should be covered by
platform_pci_set_power_state() because on some platforms the delay can
be shorter.

It may or may not.  Some platforms supply AML to run during D3hot ->
D0 transitions (and the ACPI spec allows that).

Adding those delays directly to the PCI PM code would ruin the timing
of system resume on many systems where devices go into D3cold during
suspend, or are powered off by the platform firmware later in the case
of S3 transitions.  For instance, during resume from S3, everything is
typically powered up by the platform firmware which also takes care of
the delays and the kernel effectively gets all devices in D0uninit.

Also, as stated above, IMO it is better if
platform_pci_set_power_state() takes care of the delay.

At least on some platforms, yes it does.

Moreover, the power-on may not actually happen during
platform_pci_set_power_state() for the device in question, but for its
parent.  It is quite common to provide an ACPI power resource for a
PCIe root port for bringing up the downstream link, which doesn't
really change the power state of the root port itself, but it affects
the subordinate device (and possibly everything below it).

Of course, a good question is what Alternative OSes do when
transitioning PCIe devices from D3cold to D0, but I think I can find
that out.
