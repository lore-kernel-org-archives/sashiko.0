Thanks for taking a look at this!

If pci_power_up() is doing D3cold -> D0, main power is initially off,
so platform_pci_set_power_state(PCI_D0) would turn on main power,
which is a Fundamental Reset leaving the device in D0uninitialized.
In general the device needs at least 100 ms after that reset before
any access, e.g., before the PMCSR read.

If pci_power_up() is doing D3hot -> D0, the device already has main
power, so I suppose platform_pci_set_power_state(PCI_D0) doesn't do
anything.  The device remains in D3hot, the PMCSR read should be fine,
and the PMCSR write to transition to D0 is immediately followed by the
10 ms delay.  When No_Soft_Reset == 1, this should be enough.

But when No_Soft_Reset == 0, the transition is to D0uninitialized,
which sec 2.3.1 includes as a reset condition after which the device
is permitted to return RRS.

So to me it looks like we need these delays:

  - For D3cold -> D0, msleep(100) and pci_dev_wait() between
    platform_pci_set_power_state(PCI_D0) and the PMCSR read, similar
    to what pcie_flr() does.

    Maybe platform_pci_set_power_state() takes care of some or all of
    this internally?

  - For D3hot -> D0 with No_Soft_Reset == 0, pci_dev_wait() after the
    PMCSR write to transition to D0.

    abbcf0e2a99d ("PCI: Wait for device to become ready after a power
    management reset") added the similar wait in pci_pm_reset().
