It is kind of a mixed bag because it involves platform-specific
operations (the PCIe spec doesn't define a standard method of
transitioning devices in D3cold into D0).

The consensus in the industry appears to be that if AML is used for
carrying out D3cold->D0 transitions, it is expected to take the
requisite delays into account.

It is more along the lines of what I said before: After
platform_pci_set_power_state() the device is either
Configuration-Ready, or inaccessible (in which case it can be assumed
to have dropped off the bus, but this is all platform-specific, so on
some platforms there may be ways to revive such devices).

That said, I'm all for documenting it.

On platforms using ACPI, platform_pci_set_power_state() carries out
the AML part of the transition which may do nothing for devices in
D3hot (for instance, there may be an ACPI power resource that needs to
be turned "on" in order to restore power to the device, but if the
power resource is "on" already, say because it is shared with another
device that is in D0 ATM, its state may not change).

platform_pci_set_power_state() may also be a no-op for the given
device (for example, if this is an add-on device without any
associated AML).

The rule of thumb is that if there is a programmatic way to remove
power from a PCIe device (so it can go into D3cold), it is generally
platform-specific and there should be a complementary programmatic way
to do the reverse (also generally platform-specific).  Otherwise, the
device can go only as deep as D3hot except when the system as a whole
is powered down or it is on a Thunderbolt link that can be
disconnected at any time etc.

Well, not quite, as per the above.

I guess the name is somewhat confusing, but I'm not sure what other
name would be better.
