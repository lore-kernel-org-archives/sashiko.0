I reiterate my claim that the LSM list is already being reviewed.  You
just need to enter an LSM name in the search box to see the reviewed
patch series.  They are already categorized by mailing list, only the
drop-down menu doesn't list all of them.  For instance, the latest for
AppArmor (neither the LKML nor the LSM mailing list are being explicitly
registered for Sashiko):
https://sashiko.dev/#/patchset/20260613060424.2213712-1-junxiao.chang%40intel.com

Sure, I sent this emails to start this discussion, and we can already
take a look, but I guess a drop-down menu will help.  Are you OK to
start with this drop-down menu?

I know, it's not about me.

That would be easier, but that's an option I would prefer to avoid
because I want everyone to benefit form these reviews.
