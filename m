Yes, you are right. It's impossible to support PEBS sampling for both root
and non-root mode for the legacy PEBS, and that's one main reason why the
arch-PEBS is introduced. 

But the conclusion is still correct. Before the commit 58f6217e5d01
("perf/x86/intel: KVM: Mask PEBS_ENABLE loaded for guest with vCPU's
value."), if users create a !exclude_guest event on host, the event would
be enabled in IA32_PEBS_ENABLE after the vm-entry and it would cause guest
crash if no such global guest PEBS disabling. That's the reason why the
guest PEBS is globally disabled here if there are active PEBS events on host.

After introducing the commit 58f6217e5d01 ("perf/x86/intel: KVM: Mask
PEBS_ENABLE loaded for guest with vCPU's value."), it looks this global
guest PEBS disabling becomes unnecessary any more. 

Thanks.
