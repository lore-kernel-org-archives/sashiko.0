Right, it'll miss spinlocks and rwlocks but I think it's ok.

Agreed, as I replied earlier we should use pelem->cgroup_id.

The tstamp_data is saved per-thread so it doesn't matter which thread is
calling this.  I think the concern is when - IIRC I put it at _end()
because it may reduce the overhead when we have some filters.

But it seems it's already after checking the filters.  Then it should be
ok to do in _begin().  Maybe it's a better choice doing it in _begin()
since the thread is about to go to wait for the lock and doing nothing
critical.  While at the _end(), it'll start the critical section soon.

Thanks,
Namhyung
