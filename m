Just checked the commit history, It looks the reason of disabling guest
PEBS here is to avoid breaking the host !exclude_guest PEBS event sampling.
Host may create !exclude_guest event to profile both root and non-root
mode, but it's conflicted with guest PEBS sampling in non-root mode. So
guest PEBS sampling has to be disabled if there are active host PEBS
events. Thanks.
