Hallucination alert:

CONFIG_PCI_CMA is bool, so cannot be configured as a loadable module.

Right.  Another hallucination.

If the device mutates its device identity in Config Space at runtime,
e.g. as a result of an FPGA update or hot replacement, it is necessary
to re-enumerate the device either through the standard hotplug
mechanism or manually via sysfs.  Otherwise authentication simply fails
because of the mismatch between (cached) Config Space and Subject
Alternative Name.

I think this is the correct thing to do.  The alternative would be that
we'd just carry on using the device normally even though the mismatch
tells us something's not right.

pciehp_device_replaced() already checks whether device identity in
(unsigned) Config Space has changed after resume from system sleep
and after error recovery and automatically triggers a hot unplug event.
CMA will make this check even more useful because we can trigger
hot unplug also when the device was previously authenticated but now
no longer is, e.g. because of a Subject Alternative Name mismatch.

I think it doesn't really matter whether we use cached data or read it
from Config Space, we just want to detect a mismatch with the Subject
Alternative Name.

Right.

The assumption that pdev->class may exceed 6 hex characters
is a hallucination as the 24-bit size is prescribed by the spec.

Should the expected name ever change, the CMA_NAME_MAX macro
at the top of cma.c needs to be amended.  So I don't really
see the need for scnprintf().

Hallucination.

PCIe r7.0 sec 7.9.3.2 defines the Device Serial Number as an EUI-64.

In the corresponding IEEE spec on EUIs on page 11 in section
"Unassigned and NULL EUI values", it says:

   "Many applications have found it useful to define a distinct null
    identifier, most often indicating the absence of a valid EUI-48 or
    EUI-64 value. As an example, a null value might be the power-on state
    for an integrated circuit register, until the hardware or firmware
    initializes the register with a valid EUI.
    [...]
    The all-zeros EUI-48 value (00-00-00-00-00-00) and EUI-64 value
    (00-00-00- 00-00-00-00-00), though assigned to an organization,
    have not been and will not be used by that assignee as an EUI.
    (They can be considered as assigned to the IEEE Registration Authority.)"

    https://standards.ieee.org/content/dam/ieee-standards/standards/web/documents/tutorials/eui.pdf

PCIe r6.1 sec 6.31.3 says the Device Serial Number shall be included
in the Subject Alternative Name if it is "implemented".  It is debatable
whether it can be considered implemented if the vendor neglected to
initialize it to a valid number, but I'm inclined to consider that
"not implemented".  The vendor made a mistake and signed an invalid
Device Serial Number.  That can't be considered a valid certificate then.

Again, it doesn't matter whether the data is cached or read from
Config Space.  We just want to detect a mismatch with the Subject
Alternative Name.
