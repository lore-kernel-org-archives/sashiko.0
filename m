The point of this PR and the related discussion is to enable email
replies, the reviews are already there.  As explained, my motivation for
this change is to get reviews, and without emails I suspect almost nobody
(will) take a look and that would not even be an experiment.  I'm saying
that because I forgot several times to take a look and it adds more work
to the review/maintenance.

FWIW, there are currently 41 kernel mailing lists registered:
https://github.com/sashiko-dev/sashiko/blob/main/sashiko.dev/email_policy.toml

Sure and I don't think it's an issue.  It's really easy to filter
emails on any MUA if really needed, and I'm sure the Sashiko maintainers
would be able to fix things quickly if needed.
