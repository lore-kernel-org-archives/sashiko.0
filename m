Hi Bjorn,

The reason for using the "is_rc" tag is that for Cadence IP, it is not 
only applicable to the RC or EP mode, but also there are significant 
differences between the LGA and HPA generations of IP. Including 
register offset values, definitions, etc., it fails to achieve good 
compatibility. It is not like Synopsys IP, where compatibility has been 
handled very well. It was truly out of necessity.

Yes, it has been changed in the following submission.

Commit: d9cf7154deed (PCI: cadence: Use cdns_pcie_read_sz() for byte or 
word read access)

In my submission 18ac51ae9df9 ("PCI: cadence: Implement capability 
search using PCI core APIs"). It works very well for the Root Port. (For 
drivers/pci/controller/cadence/pci-sky1.c, no other upstream code has 
been implemented yet. It is functioning properly in the product.)

Agree. I will make some revisions. I've recently found some time to 
conduct a CIX SOC test.

I would like to refer to:

struct pci_dev {
     ......
     u8			pcie_cap;	/* PCIe capability offset */
     ......
};

Additionally, I have already created a series of patches here locally to 
simplify the DWC driver. This is because each Root Port driver is 
looking at the PCI_CAP_ID_EXP offset.

Best regards,
Hans
